## ❔FAQ

#### Can I use C# with this plugin?

The C# is not actually supported, I will work on it if it's needed, but for now I want first to finish this plugin feature before maybe doing it. If needed, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Ward727a/godot_datatable_plugin/issues)

#### I created my table, and added elements in it, how can I access it?

You can access it by using the `datatable_` class, please be aware that this class will be renamed to `datatable` in the next version!
